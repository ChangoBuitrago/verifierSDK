## verifier.ts

The primary issue is in the `createRequest` method, which incorrectly handles the creation of policy instances and violates the principle of dependency injection.

### Architectural Issue: Violating Dependency Injection

The more significant issue is architectural. The SDK's `createRequest` method should not be responsible for creating (`new policy()`) its own dependencies.

Following the "Lego block" design, the service using the SDK should be responsible for **creating and configuring** all the modules (like policy instances) and then passing the ready-to-use instances to the SDK. This keeps the SDK simple, predictable, and decoupled from the implementation details of its plugins.

### The Correct Approach

The `createRequest` method should expect to receive an array of **pre-configured policy instances**.

```javascript
// Corrected Approach
createRequest(
  options: CredentialVerifierRequestOptions
): CredentialVerifierPresentationRequest {
  // The 'options.policies' array should already contain fully-formed policy instances.
  const credentialRequirements =
    options.policies?.map((policyInstance) => {
      // Now we can safely call methods on each instance.
      return {
        ...policyInstance.getCredentialConstraints(),
        proofOptions: {
          purpose: options.proofOptions.purpose,
          type: options.proofOptions.type,
        },
      };
    }) ?? [];

  return {
    id: Math.random().toString(36).substring(2),
    credentials: credentialRequirements,
    proofOptions: options.proofOptions,
  };
}
```

### Flawed Policy Instantiation

The main problem lies in this block of code:

```javascript
const policies = options.policies?.map((policy) => {
  if (typeof policy === "function") {
    return new policy(); // Problematic line
  }
  return policy;
});
```

1.  **Unsafe Instantiation**: The line `new policy()` assumes that any function passed in is a class constructor that can be instantiated without arguments. This is a fragile assumption that can easily break.
2.  **Inconsistent Array**: If the `policies` option contains a mix of class constructors and already-created instances, this code will produce an array with a mix of types. The next `map` loop, which calls `policy.getCredentialConstraints()`, will then fail when it encounters a class constructor that doesn't have this method.


## policy.ts

The main issue with this code is that it's **too specific to a single credential model**, which conflicts with our goal of a truly format-agnostic design.

* **Incomplete & Inextensible Policy Interface**: The `CredentialPolicy` interface is missing the `execute()` method, which is a critical flaw for an extensible system. By removing this method, all validation logic becomes centralized in the core `verify` function. This function would then need to become a large, complex interpreter that understands every possible constraint a policy could ever define. This approach violates the principle of **encapsulation**, as the logic for a rule is no longer self-contained.

    The primary issue is the loss of **extensibility**. If you wanted to add a new, custom rule‚Äîfor example, a policy that checks if a transaction date is a business day‚Äîyou couldn't just create a new policy. You would be forced to modify the core Verifier SDK to teach it how to check for business days. In contrast, a policy with an `execute()` method is a **self-contained, pluggable module** üß±. It carries its own unique validation logic, allowing developers to add any imaginable rule just by creating a new policy, without ever touching the core SDK.

* **Rigid Data Structure**: The `VerificationData` interface hardcodes a specific data structure (`credentialSubject`, `issuer`, etc.). Our agnostic design uses a generic `VerificationSubject` containing an `unknown` presentation, allowing specialized **Handlers** to parse completely different formats (like mDL or SD-JWT) without forcing them into a single, rigid shape.

* **Reduced Flexibility**: By defining these specific structures at the core level, the system loses the flexibility to easily support new credential formats that might not have an "issuer" or "credentialSubject" in the same way.

## vc-vp.ts

There are two main issues with this code: it's too specific to one data model, and it uses an overly broad type for formats.

### 1. Inflexible, W3C-Specific Interfaces

The primary problem is that the `VerifiableCredential` and `VerifiablePresentation` interfaces hardcode the structure of a **W3C JSON-LD credential**. This fundamentally conflicts with the goal of a credential-agnostic system.

* **Forces a Single Shape**: This design forces other formats to be artificially molded into a JSON-LD structure. For example, an **SD-JWT** is just a string, and an **mDL** is a CBOR byte array. They don't have properties like `credentialSubject` or `@context` in their native form.
* **Breaks the Handler Model**: A truly agnostic system relies on specialized **Handlers**, where each handler understands the unique native structure of its format. These rigid, top-level interfaces prevent that by assuming all credentials look the same.

### 2. Overly Broad `Format` Type

The `Format` type is too granular and mixes different levels of abstraction. It includes specific profiles (`jwt-vc`) alongside general formats (`jwt`) and protocol-specific terms (`ac_vc`). A more robust approach is to use a smaller set of high-level format identifiers (like `'w3c_vc'`, `'sd_jwt'`, `'mso_mdoc'`) that the core verifier can use to select the correct handler.

## interfaces.ts

The main issues with this code are that it's not truly credential-agnostic and it mixes responsibilities in a way that makes the system rigid.

### Architectural Issues

* **Flawed Dependency Handling**: The `CredentialVerifierRequestOptions` interface accepts an array of `policies` that can be either instances or class constructors (`new () => CredentialPolicy`). As discussed before, this is a flawed pattern. The SDK should not be responsible for creating its own dependencies (`new CredentialPolicy()`); it should receive pre-configured instances, following the principle of **Dependency Injection**.

* **Lack of Credential Agnosticism**: The `verify` method's signature, `verify(presentation: VerifiablePresentation, ...)`, tightly couples the entire verification process to the W3C Verifiable Presentation data model. This makes it impossible to verify other formats like SD-JWT (a string) or mDL (a byte array) without changing the core SDK interface. A truly agnostic design would accept an `unknown` presentation and use **pluggable Handlers** to parse it.

* **Overly Complex Configuration**: The `CredentialVerifierOptions` requires a map of `cryptosuites`, and the `CredentialVerifierRequestOptions` has deeply nested `proofOptions`. In our refined agnostic design, these dependencies are encapsulated. For example, the **Handler** module is responsible for managing its own crypto suites, which simplifies the top-level configuration significantly.

## index.ts

The only issue is a lack of **clarity in naming**, which can cause confusion between the public interface and the internal implementation.


### Naming and Clarity

The code uses the generic name `Verifier` for the concrete class, while the public interface is called `CredentialVerifier`. This can be ambiguous. A better practice is to make the implementation's name more specific to distinguish it from the abstract interface.

### Improved Version

This version uses more descriptive names to clearly separate the public interface (`CredentialVerifier`) from the internal class (`CredentialVerifierImpl`), making the code's intent easier to understand.

```typescript
// --- File: my-sdk/index.ts ---

import { CredentialVerifier, CredentialVerifierOptions } from "./interfaces";
// Import the concrete implementation, which is an internal detail.
import { CredentialVerifierImpl } from "./verifier";

/**
 * Factory function to create a configured Verifier instance.
 */
export function createCredentialVerifier(
  options: CredentialVerifierOptions
): CredentialVerifier {
  // Return a new instance of the implementation class.
  return new CredentialVerifierImpl(options);
}
```

## cryptosuites.ts

This code is functionally correct, but its design is **rigid and not extensible**, which conflicts with a flexible, pluggable architecture.

By using TypeScript `union` types (e.g., `EdDSACryptosuite`), you are creating a hardcoded, closed list of all supported cryptographic suites and algorithms.

The main issue is that to support a **new crypto suite** in the future (for example, one based on a new quantum-safe algorithm), you would be forced to modify this core type definition file and release a new version of the entire SDK.

Here is a side-by-side example demonstrating the difference.

-----

### Rigid Design (Using Union Types)

This design isn't extensible. To add a new `Bbs-2023` suite, you'd have to modify the core `CryptosuiteType` in the SDK itself.

```typescript
// --- SDK's Core Type Definitions ---
export type ECDSACryptosuite = "ecdsa-jcs-2019" | "ecdsa-sd-2023";
export type EdDSACryptosuite = "Ed25519Signature2020";
export type CryptosuiteType = ECDSACryptosuite | EdDSACryptosuite;

// --- Application Code ---
// This would cause a TypeScript error because "Bbs-2023"
// is not part of the hardcoded CryptosuiteType.
const myNewSuiteType: CryptosuiteType = "Bbs-2023"; // ‚ùå ERROR
```

-----

### Flexible Design (Using Strings)

This design is fully extensible. The SDK's core types are open, and you can introduce new crypto suites just by configuring them at runtime.

```typescript
// --- SDK's Core Type Definitions ---
// The SDK simply expects a string, making it open to any new type.
export type CryptosuiteType = string;

// --- Application Code ---
// 1. You define a new, custom crypto suite module.
const bbs2023Suite = {
  verifyProof: async (proof) => { /* ... verification logic ... */ }
};

// 2. You configure the verifier with your new suite.
// No TypeScript errors occur.
const verifier = new Verifier({
  handlers: [
    new W3cHandler({
      'Bbs-2023': bbs2023Suite, // ‚úÖ Works perfectly
      'Ed25519Signature2020': ed25519Suite,
    })
  ]
});
```

## constrains.ts


### The Problem: Reinventing the Wheel

The main issue with creating custom constraint interfaces is that they reinvent **JSON Schema**.

JSON Schema is the mature, industry-standard language for defining and validating the structure of JSON data. Instead of building a custom constraint system, it's far more powerful and interoperable to use JSON Schema directly. This lets you leverage a massive ecosystem of existing, battle-tested validation libraries.

### A Better Approach: The `SchemaPolicy`

The best way to integrate this into the SDK is through a specialized **`SchemaPolicy`**. This policy is constructed with a standard JSON Schema and uses it for both defining requirements and executing validation.

```javascript
import Ajv from "ajv";
const ajv = new Ajv();

/**
 * A Policy that uses a standard JSON Schema for validation.
 */
class SchemaPolicy {
  private schema: object;

  constructor(schema: object) {
    this.schema = schema;
  }

  /**
   * The requirements are simply the JSON Schema itself.
   */
  getRequirements() {
    return {
      schema: this.schema,
    };
  }

  /**
   * The execution uses a standard library to validate claims against the schema.
   */
  async execute(subject) {
    const claims = subject.presentation.verifiableCredential[0].credentialSubject;
    const validate = ajv.compile(this.schema);
    const isCompliant = validate(claims);
    
    return { 
      compliant: isCompliant, 
      error: isComplant ? undefined : ajv.errorsText(validate.errors)
    };
  }
}

// --- How it's used ---

// 1. Define your requirements using standard JSON Schema.
const ageCredentialSchema = {
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    age_over_18: { type: 'boolean', const: true },
    birthdate: { type: 'string', format: 'date' },
  },
  required: ['age_over_18', 'birthdate'],
};

// 2. Create a policy instance with the schema.
const mySchemaPolicy = new SchemaPolicy(ageCredentialSchema);

// 3. Configure the verifier with your policy.
const verifier = createCredentialVerifier({
  policies: {
    'age_credential_check': mySchemaPolicy,
  }
});
```
